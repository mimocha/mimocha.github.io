# About This Website

---

[<img src="./Gatsby_Monogram.png" alt="GatsbyJS"/>](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

This portfolio website was made using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a framework for making static webpages with React.
You can also find their Github repository [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).
Everything you see is either made from scratch, or part of the Gatsby's [plugin library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/).

The base design of this website was largely based on [Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com/) design language, as the original prototypes were in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with Bootstrap styling. The design then stuck around throughout the development of this site, though things are likely to change over the coming years, as I become a better frontend dev.

The contents are managed using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), which is Gatsby's recommended method of handling files and page generation. Right now I'm limited to markdown-based posts manually written, but I hope to eventually add automatic linking of Github repos, and live code demos of my work, etc. That's still far off though...
